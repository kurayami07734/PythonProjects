Abstract
Vitiligo, characterized by the loss of skin color in patches that tend to enlarge over
time, can impact any part of the body, including hair and the inside of the mouth.
While this condition does not inflict physical harm, its psychological toll is significant,
often leading to stress and body image concerns for those affected.[5]
Dermatologists employ various diagnostic methods, such as biopsies, blood tests,
and patch testing under specialized lamps, to confirm the presence of Vitiligo. These
diagnostic tools help healthcare professionals understand the extent and charac-
teristics of the condition. Once diagnosed, treatment approaches typically involve
medications aimed at halting the progression of depigmentation or promoting repig-
mentation. [4]
Several Machine Learning models were developed for binary image classification
to detect Vitiligo, leveraging rchitecture and Transfer Learning with the pre-trained
ResNet model. The training dataset comprised 3628 images.
The basic CNN model demonstrated commendable performance with an accuracy
of 0.8153, a recall rate of 0.9949, and a precision score of 0.7548. To enhance the
model’s robustness, a Convolutional Neural Network model with data augmentation
was implemented, resulting in improved metrics: accuracy at 0.8707, recall at 0.9221,
and precision at 0.8595.
The ResNet50 model, known for its deep architecture, exhibited substantial ef-
ficacy even without data augmentation, achieving an accuracy of 0.9091, a recall of
0.9123, and a precision of 0.9262. The addition of data augmentation further ele-
vated the ResNet50 model’s performance, yielding an impressive accuracy of 0.9659,
a recall of 0.9661, and a precision of 0.9756.

1 Introduction
The surge in Machine Learning and Deep Learning models within healthcare presents
a crucial augmentation to medical professionals’ diagnostic capabilities, offering a
much-needed support system. The development of Artifical Intelligence-enabled
medical equipment has become a focal point, aiming to alleviate the burdens on
overworked healthcare practitioners. These technologies, particularly adept at ana-
lyzing medical images like X-rays and mammograms, enhance disease detection and
diagnosis.
By employing ML and DL algorithms, AI-equipped systems can discern intricate
patterns and anomalies in medical images, providing a level of detail that might
escape human observation. This not only improves diagnostic accuracy but also
accelerates the decision-making process, crucial in time-sensitive situations. Ongo-
ing research is expanding the scope of applications, encompassing various medical
conditions and imaging modalities.
Figure 1: Emerging use of AI in medical diagnosis
The collaborative integration of AI into medical workflows acts as an additional
layer of scrutiny, streamlining processes for healthcare professionals. However, it’s
important to emphasize that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement
for human expertise. The synergy between AI and medical professionals holds the
potential to enhance patient outcomes and optimize resource allocation.
As these technologies mature, their role in medical diagnosis and treatment is set
to become more prominent, contributing to a more resilient and efficient healthcare
system. The ongoing evolution of AI in healthcare reflects a promising trajectory,
where advanced technologies work hand in hand with human professionals to address
the growing complexities of the medical landscape.

1.1 Medical information on Vitiligo
1.1.1 Symptoms
Vitiligo is characterized by the development of white patches on the skin due to the
loss of melanocytes, the cells responsible for pigmentation. The primary symptom
is depigmentation, resulting in distinct white or light-colored patches on the skin.
Figure 2: Extensive symmetric facial Vitiligo [2]
These patches often expand over time and can appear on various parts of the
body, including the face, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. Vitiligo is gener-
ally asymptomatic, but individuals may experience cosmetic concerns, psychological
distress, or sensitivity to sunlight in affected areas. [5]
1.1.2 Causes
Figure 3: Medical diagram of Vitiligo [5]
The exact causes of vitiligo are not fully understood, but it is widely considered to
be an autoimmune condition. The immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys
3/23
20117005 Vitiligo Detection Aditya Ghidora
melanocytes, leading to depigmentation. Genetic factors play a role, as individuals
with a family history of vitiligo have a higher risk of developing the condition.
Additionally, environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals or
stress, may contribute to the onset or exacerbation of vitiligo. Disorders like thyroid
dysfunction and diabetes are associated with an increased risk of vitiligo. While
there is no cure, various treatments aim to manage symptoms and potentially restore
pigment in affected areas. [5]
1.2 Motivation
Capitalizing on the widespread availability of smartphones and laptops, a techni-
cal initiative aims to develop an app offering the general public a preliminary self-
assessment of their medical condition. By leveraging machine learning algorithms
and advanced image analysis, the application provides users with an accessible in-
terface for health diagnostics.
This endeavor seeks to democratize healthcare by utilizing personal devices to
bridge the gap between limited access to medical equipment and individual health
awareness. The app’s functionality empowers users to take proactive measures for
their well-being, potentially leading to early interventions and improved health out-
comes.

2 Literature Review
In reference [7], the authors employed a seven-class imbalanced dataset, encompass-
ing images of Acne, Eczema, Pityriasis Rosea, Psoriasis, Tinea Corporis, Varicella,
and Vitiligo, totaling 3406 images for model training. Their implemented model,
based on MobileNet and fine-tuned, achieved an accuracy of 94.4%. Notably, the
fine-tuning process yielded 84.28% accuracy. To enhance model performance, the
authors applied data augmentation and oversampling techniques, resulting in the
highest accuracy of 94.4%.
In [6], the focus shifted to binary classification of Vitiligo in a dataset comprising
1202 images, differentiating between Vitiligo and Healthy conditions. The authors
explored various techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes,
and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Inception V3. Due the limited
dataset, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 99.9%, highlighting the
need of more data in the context of binary classification.
Model Technique Size of Dataset Accuracy
Decision Trees with Inception V3 1202 97.8%
Random Forests with Inception V3 1202 99.9%
CNN with Inception V3 1202 99.8%
Naive Bayes with Inception V3 1202 99.5%
CNN with MobileNet 3406 94.4%
Table 1: Comparison of models created by relevant papers
The aforementioned outcomes indicate that the optimal approach involves the
incorporation of Transfer Learning in conjunction with CNN. Fine-tuning such a
model on an expansive dataset is suggested to produce superior results.
This strategic combination leverages the pre-existing knowledge encoded in a
pre-trained model and refines its parameters through fine-tuning on a larger dataset.
The technical synergy of TL and CNN architecture, when applied and adjusted
in this manner, is anticipated to yield the most favorable outcomes in terms of model
accuracy and performance.
3 Materials and Methods
This section delineates the methodology employed in the creation of the dataset
and expounds on the techniques utilized for developing models aimed at detecting
Vitiligo.
The elucidation encompasses the intricacies of dataset compilation, encompassing
initial data extraction from diverse sources and subsequent amalgamation.
5/23
20117005 Vitiligo Detection Aditya Ghidora
Furthermore, it delves into the technical nuances of employing various method-
ologies in the model creation process, shedding light on the systematic approaches
applied to enhance the efficacy of Vitiligo detection models.
3.1 Data collection
Vitiligo images were sourced from diverse repositories, initially originating from a
singular Kaggle dataset containing 500 images. Subsequently, the dataset was en-
riched by incorporating images from AtlasNet, DermNet, and stock image websites
such as Shutterstock and iStock.
To ensure comprehensive representation, images for the healthy class were se-
lected to encompass a broad spectrum of ethnicities and variations in hair presence,
accommodating the model’s effectiveness across diverse skin types. The resulting
dataset was then publicly shared on Kaggle, facilitating accessibility for research
and development within the scientific community. [1]

Table 2: Classwise split of dataset
3.2 Techniques used for creating models
3.2.1 Data Augmentation
Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the dataset through transforma-
tions applied to images. These transformations encompass random operations such
as zooming, rotating, flipping, inverting, altering contrast, adjusting brightness, and
more. In this context, specific transformations like random zooms, flips, and crops
were selected due to their non-pixel value manipulation nature.
Contrast manipulation was intentionally excluded from the augmentation pro-
cess, considering that Vitiligo involves abnormal skin discoloration. The avoidance
of contrast adjustments is crucial to prevent potential interference with the fidelity
of the model’s results in the context of Vitiligo detection.
3.2.2 Data preprocessing
TensorFlow mandates uniform image dimensions, necessitating the resizing of all
images to 256 × 256. To expedite convergence, neural networks exhibit faster training
when pixel values are confined within the [0, 1] domain. Consequently, pixel values
were normalized by dividing them by 255.
The dataset underwent a tripartite division into training, testing, and valida-
tion sets, with proportions allocated as 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively. This
6/23
20117005 Vitiligo Detection Aditya Ghidora
segmentation ensures a systematic and standardized distribution for model training,
evaluation, and validation, adhering to established practices in machine learning.
3.2.3 Transfer Learning
Transfer learning involves leveraging a pre-trained model, initially trained for a more
generalized task, and subsequently retraining it on a more specific and condensed
dataset.
In this context, ResNet50, a model originally trained on the expansive ImageNet
dataset comprising over a million images, has been employed.
This strategy allows the model to benefit from the learned features and repre-
sentations from the broader dataset, enhancing its capacity to discern and extract
relevant patterns in the targeted domain of interest.
Figure 5: Architecture of the ResNet50 model
3.3 Training the models
3.3.1 Resources utilized
The initial models, characterized by their simplicity and modest size, were amenable
to training on a laptop equipped with 8GB of Random Access Memory and a quad-
core Intel Central Processing Unit. However, the computational demands of the
ResNet models surpassed the capabilities of the laptop’s resources.
Consequently, these more intricate models necessitated the utilization of Kaggle’s
Graphical Processing Unit resources, specifically the P100 model, to accommodate
the heightened computational requirements.
The fine-tuning process for the ResNet models, executed on the Kaggle GPU,
incurred a total training time of 849 seconds. This shift to GPU acceleration signifi-
cantly expedited the training process, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities
inherent in GPUs to enhance the efficiency of model optimization.
The transition to more robust hardware resources reflects the pragmatic adap-
tation to the escalating complexities and computational demands associated with
fine-tuning intricate neural network architectures.
7/23
20117005 Vitiligo Detection Aditya Ghidora
3.3.2 Training and evaluation protocols
The training process was conducted over 20 epochs, representing the number of
complete passes through the entire dataset. The validation set, constituting 10%
of the dataset, was utilized for assessing model performance during training. Key
performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, were systematically
monitored throughout the training phase to gauge the model’s proficiency in distin-
guishing between Vitiligo and healthy instances.
This methodology ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s learning
progress and generalization capabilities. The choice of 20 epochs strikes a balance
between allowing the model to sufficiently learn the underlying patterns in the data
and preventing overfitting. The continuous tracking of accuracy, precision, and recall
serves as crucial indicators for model convergence and effectiveness in the context of
Vitiligo detection.
In the training of the Vitiligo detection models, the choice of the loss function
was binary cross-entropy. This particular loss function is well-suited for binary clas-
sification tasks, such as distinguishing between Vitiligo and non-Vitiligo instances.
Binary cross-entropy quantifies the dissimilarity between predicted and actual
class probabilities, serving as a pivotal component in optimizing the model parame-
ters during the training process.
For the fine-tuning phase, a learning rate of 10−5 was employed. The learning
rate is a hyperparameter that dictates the step size taken during the optimization
process.
In the context of fine-tuning, a relatively low learning rate is often favored to
ensure gradual adjustments to the pre-trained model’s weights.
This cautious learning rate mitigates the risk of overfitting and enables the model
to refine its parameters without compromising the knowledge encoded in the pre-
existing layers, contributing to the effective adaptation of the model to the specific
nuances of Vitiligo detection.
4 Challenges and Limitations
The development of the machine learning model for Vitiligo detection, while promis-
ing, is not without challenges and limitations. One prominent challenge is the po-
tential for bias in the dataset, impacting the model’s generalizability across diverse
populations. The imbalanced distribution of Vitiligo and non-Vitiligo instances may
lead to a skewed model, affecting its ability to discern rare patterns. Additionally,
the reliance on image data might pose challenges in cases where other clinical data
could provide valuable context.
The computational demands, especially for more complex models like ResNet,
present a limitation, necessitating access to specialized hardware for efficient training.
The dependency on GPUs, as observed in your transition to Kaggle for ResNet model
training, highlights this resource-intensive aspect.
Moreover, the interpretability of deep learning models remains a challenge, mak-
8/23
20117005 Vitiligo Detection Aditya Ghidora
ing it challenging to understand and explain the decision-making processes of the
model. Ensuring ethical considerations in deploying the model, particularly regard-
ing issues of fairness and potential biases, is crucial.
These challenges and limitations underscore the need for ongoing refinement,
transparency, and consideration of broader ethical implications in the development
and deployment of machine learning models for dermatological diagnoses. Future
iterations should aim to address these constraints for a more robust and inclusive
Vitiligo detection system.
An additional noteworthy limitation of the developed models is their suscepti-
bility to generating inaccurate results when presented with irrelevant images. Since
the models are trained specifically for Vitiligo detection, introducing images outside
the scope of dermatological conditions could lead to misinterpretations.
The inherent nature of deep learning models, especially convolutional neural net-
works, involves learning intricate patterns specific to the trained domain. When
confronted with unrelated or non-dermatological images, the models may produce
unpredictable outcomes, potentially yielding false positives or inaccurate classifica-
tions.
This limitation emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the input data aligns
with the intended use case and that the models are deployed within the context for
which they were meticulously trained. Rigorous validation and input constraints are
essential to mitigate the risk of erroneous outputs when confronted with irrelevant
or out-of-scope image data.
5 ML Models
5.1 Simple CNN Model
The exploratory phase of this endeavor commenced with the implementation of the
most basic machine learning model suitable for image classification — the Convo-
lutional Neural Network (CNN). In its initial instantiation, the architecture was
configured with three convolutional blocks, each comprising a convolutional layer
succeeded by a max-pooling layer.
This simplified structure was selected to establish a foundational understanding
of the task, prioritizing simplicity for initial experimentation. Subsequent iterations
and model refinements were guided by the insights gained from this foundational
CNN configuration, paving the way for the exploration of more intricate architectures
and techniques.

Recognizing the limitations of the initial model’s efficacy in learning intricate pat-
terns, a strategic intervention was implemented. To address this, the dataset size
was augmented through the techniques elucidated in section 3.2.1. However, the
fundamental architecture of the model remained unaltered, and instead, data aug-
mentation layers were introduced as an augmentation strategy.

These additional layers were appended atop the existing model structure. The
objective was to enhance the model’s capacity to discern complex patterns and vari-
ations within the data, leveraging the diversified information generated through data
augmentation processes. This iterative refinement aimed at improving the model’s
robustness and performance by providing it with a more extensive and varied dataset.

pre-trained ResNet50 architecture.
The fine-tuning process involved keeping the layers concise, prioritizing a stream-
lined model architecture tailored to the intricacies of the Vitiligo dataset.
By adhering to a simplified layer structure, the objective was to strike a balance
between leveraging the learned features from the broader ImageNet dataset while

8 Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations play a pivotal role in the development and deployment of
machine learning models for Vitiligo detection. Firstly, it’s crucial to address issues
of fairness and potential biases in the dataset and model predictions. Biases can
arise from imbalances in the training data or reflect existing disparities in healthcare
access. Efforts should be made to ensure the model does not disproportionately
impact specific demographics, mitigating potential social and ethical implications.
Informed consent is another ethical cornerstone, especially when involving med-
ical data. Participants contributing images for model training should be fully in-
formed about the purpose, risks, and potential benefits of the study. Strict privacy
measures should be implemented to safeguard sensitive health information, adhering
to relevant data protection regulations.
Transparency and interpretability are paramount. Understanding how the model
reaches its conclusions is crucial for building trust among users and healthcare practi-
tioners. Efforts to make the decision-making process of the model more interpretable
contribute to the ethical use of machine learning in healthcare.
Additionally, continuous monitoring and auditing of the model’s performance
post-deployment are necessary to identify and rectify any emerging ethical concerns.
Regular evaluations can address issues such as concept drift, ensuring the model
remains relevant and reliable over time.
By addressing these ethical considerations, the development and application of
machine learning models for Vitiligo detection can align with principles of fairness,
transparency, privacy, and accountability, fostering responsible and ethical integra-
tion into healthcare practices.
9 Future scope
To enhance the generality and efficacy of Vitiligo detection using machine learn-
ing techniques, a strategic approach involves the initiation of a large-scale medical
study. This study would entail the inclusion of vitiligo patients from diverse back-
grounds, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the population. Participants
would contribute image samples for training models, encompassing a broad spectrum
of ethnicities, skin types, and variations in the manifestation of the skin disease.
Improved hardware resources would play a pivotal role in this endeavor, offering
the capacity to train more sophisticated and complex models. The increased com-
putational capabilities would facilitate the exploration of advanced neural network
architectures, potentially incorporating deeper and more intricate structures. This
adaptability to more complex models is crucial for capturing the subtle intricacies
inherent in the manifestation of vitiligo across diverse populations.
Furthermore, a large-scale medical study would not only contribute to a more
expansive and representative dataset but also enhance the robustness and generaliz-
ability of the machine learning models. The amalgamation of diverse patient data,
coupled with advancements in hardware, holds the potential to propel Vitiligo de-
